# Document Management System

The system manages documents, users and user roles. Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date it was published.

Users are categorized by roles. Each user must have a role defined for them.

## Installation

* Ensure that you have NodeJs and Postgres installed on your machine
* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/andela-msosan/document-management.git`
* Change into the directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Create a `.env` file in your root directory as described in `.env.sample` file
* Create a `data.json` file in your root directory as described in `data-sample.json` if you will like to seed data into your database after migration

## Testing

* To test, run `npm test`
* To generate coverage after test, run `npm run cover`

## Usage

* Run database migration with `npm run db:migrate`
* Run `npm run db:seed` to seed data into your database
* Start the app with `npm start`. By default, it runs locally on port 5000
* Use [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) or any API testing tool to access the endpoints
